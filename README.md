# No-Parking-Vehicle-Number-Plate-Recognition
Project Description: No-Parking Vehicle Number Plate Recognition
The No-Parking Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System is an advanced, AI-driven solution aimed at enforcing parking regulations in restricted areas. By leveraging computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies, this system identifies vehicles parked in no-parking zones, extracts their registration numbers, and logs violations for further action.

The project is designed to automate the monitoring process, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. It processes live camera feeds or recorded video to detect vehicles, recognize license plates, and validate them against a database of authorized vehicles. Upon detecting a violation, it can generate alerts, send notifications, or maintain records for future analysis.

This system is ideal for traffic management authorities, residential complexes, commercial establishments, and public spaces where parking regulations must be strictly enforced. The project focuses on improving compliance, streamlining enforcement, and enhancing the overall efficiency of parking management.
